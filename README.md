## Installation 

###Â Prerequisites

First, install the Haskell compiler and the cabal Haskell package manager
* Linux (kernel >= 3.2, 3.8 recommended)
* ghc >= 7.6 [http://www.haskell.org/platform/linux.html]
* cabal >= 1.18

If you are installing cabal for the first time (or you have issues running the build commands), you may want to upgrade cabal (as well as Haskell core packages) itself to the latest version (to get the `cabal sandbox` command and avoid other incompatibility issues). You can install a new version of cabal in your home directory using: 
```sh
$ cabal update
$ cabal install cabal-install
$ export PATH=$(echo ~/.cabal/bin):$PATH
```

### Build and install
```sh
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install --only-dependencies
$ cabal configure 
$ sudo cabal install --prefix=/usr/local/hgc-tools
```

If you'd like users other than root to run hgc-deploy, it must be setuid root:
```sh
$ sudo chmod u+s /usr/local/hgc-tools/bin/hgc-deploy
```

The usage of a range of years within a copyright statement contained within this distribution should be interpreted as being equivalent to a list of years including the first and last year specified and all consecutive years between them. For example, a copyright statement that reads 'Copyright (c) 2005, 2007- 2009, 2011-2012' should be interpreted as being identical to a statement that reads 'Copyright (c) 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012' and a copyright statement that reads "Copyright (c) 2005-2012' should be interpreted as being identical to a statement that reads 'Copyright (c) 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012'."
